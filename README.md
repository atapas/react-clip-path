# react-clip-path
`react-clip-path` is a React-based open-source project to create shapes declaratively using `CSS` clip-path property. It is available as NPM to download and install.

# üî• Why do you need this?
You may need `react-clip-path` when,

- You need to show lightweight shapes in your React app. 
- You may not want to rely on any external graph or chart libraries to create shapes.
- You may want to create some custom shapes using a polygon, paths, etc.
- You need to create shapes declaratively by extending the out-of-the-box schema.

# üíª Live Demo
A Live demo of the component is available here, üíª [CLICK FOR DEMO](https://react-clip-path.netlify.app/)

## Import
Next is to import the component from the library.

First import the `Shape` component,

```js
import Shape from 'react-clip-path';
```
## Usage
After import, we can now use it in any React component.

```js
<Shape
    name="Circle"
    width="300px"
    height="300px"
    showLabel={true}
    showShadow={true}
/>
```

# Schema & Extending it
The `react-clip-path` depends on a `schema` file to get the shape information. You can extend the schema by introducing a new shape definition. Shape information contains,

- name of the shape
- shape type
- clip-path code of the shape
- number of vertices
- number of edges
- Any optional notes about the shape.

Here is an example of the `circle` shape in the schema file,

```js
{
  'name': 'Circle',
  'type': 'circle',
  'formula': 'circle(50% at 50% 50%)',
  'vertices': 0,
  'edges': 0,
  'notes': 'A circle is a round shaped figure that has no corners or edges. In geometry, a circle can be defined as a closed, two-dimensional curved shape.'
}
```

The same schema file also contains a few utility methods. You can import them as,

```js
import { getShape } from 'react-clip-path/schema';

getShape('Circle'); // returns the details of the Circle shape.
```
